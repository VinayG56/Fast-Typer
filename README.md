* <h3>This Fast Typer App is created by using beautiful styling using BOOTSTRAP.</h3>
* <h3>We can set the different levels in the game of having 3 or 5 or 10 seconds per word.</h3>
* <h3>If we type the word displayed within the selected seconds then another word will appear and then set the level for the next word.</h3>
* <h3>The score will increase if we type a word within the seconds taken.</h3>
# Updates to be done
* <h4>I have to make the website full stack using MERN technology.<h4/>
* <h4>Then I can store the scores and take the high scores from them.<h4/>
